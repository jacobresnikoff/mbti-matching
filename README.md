# Creating an MBTI Matching Algorithm

This project utilizes a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) to serve as inputs for a matching algorithm. By utilizing these traits we may predict compatibility between a pair of individuals, or perhaps in team compositions.
